<h1>Sophomore Year</h1>

<p>
  My first year at Horizon Science Academy - Columbus High School was a bit challenging because I took a Web Design and Programming class. 
  The class was difficult at first because the teacher mainly made us copy code instead of teaching us how to write it ourselves. 
  As a result, I didn't learn much about coding during that time. However, the teacher did show us some code examples, which helped me understand a little. 
  Copying was the main problem, but apart from that, everything else about the class was good. Although coding wasn't my favorite, this experience helped me learn and improve my skills for my third year at the school.
