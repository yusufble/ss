<h1>Junior Year</h1>

<p>
  My second year at Web Design and Programming was more challenging because I took a class in that subject. This time, the teacher showed us how to do things and explained what we needed to create on our own. She would show us a picture, and then we had to code that picture ourselves.
</p>
<p>
  At first, it was really hard for me because I had no idea what I was doing. However, as time went by, I improved in coding and became better at completing my work. Overall, it was a difficult but rewarding experience that helped me learn and grow.
